          Complaints and Grievances
        </h3>
        <h3 className='font-semibold'>
          Procedure for Raising Complaints and Grievances
        </h3>
        <span>
          At Soltec, we are committed to maintaining a learning and working
          environment that is fair, respectful, and conducive to the personal
          and academic development of our students. We recognize that concerns,
          complaints, and grievances may arise from time to time, and we have
          established a procedure to address and resolve such matters. This
          procedure is designed to ensure that all complaints and grievances are
          handled promptly and fairly.
        </span>
        <h3 className='mt-1 font-semibold'>Informal Resolution</h3>
        <span>
          Students are encouraged to initially seek informal resolution of their
          concerns. This may involve discussing the issue with the relevant
          faculty member, staff, or supervisor involved in the matter. Students
          can also consult with academic advisors, mentors, or the student
          support services for guidance in addressing their concerns.
        </span>
        <h3 className='mt-1 font-semibold'>Formal Resolution </h3>
        <span>
          In cases where informal resolution is not feasible or satisfactory,
          students may initiate a formal complaint or grievance following these
          steps:
        </span>
        <span>
          -Filing a Complaint or Grievance: The student must submit a written
          complaint or grievance to the designated office or authority. The
          written complaint should include a clear and concise description of
          the issue, any relevant documentation, and the desired resolution.
        </span>
        <span>
          -Investigation: Soltec will appoint an impartial investigator or
          committee to review the complaint or grievance. The investigator(s)
          will examine the evidence, interview relevant parties, and conduct a
          thorough investigation.
        </span>
        <span>
          -Resolution: After the investigation, the Academy will make a
          reasonable effort to reach a fair and just resolution. This may
          involve corrective actions, mediation, or other appropriate remedies.
          The Academy will communicate the decision in writing to the student.
        </span>
        <h3 className='mt-1 font-semibold'>Conflict Resolution Process </h3>
        <h3 className='font-semibold'>Mediation</h3>
        <span>
          In cases where disputes or conflicts persist, students may have the
          option to participate in mediation with a neutral third party.
          Mediation is a voluntary and confidential process aimed at
          facilitating open and constructive communication between parties.
          Soltec will make mediation services available to students when
          appropriate.
        </span>
        <h3 className='mt-1 font-semibold'>Appeal</h3>
        <span>
          If a student is not satisfied with the resolution at the institutional
          level, they may have the right to appeal. The appeal process will be
          outlined in the resolution letter provided by the Academy. Appeals
          typically involve a review by a higher-level authority within the
          institution.
        </span>
        <h3 className='mt-1 font-semibold'>Recordkeeping</h3>
        <span>
          Soltec will maintain records of all formal complaints and grievances,
          including the complaint, investigation, resolution, and any appeals.
          These records will be kept confidential in accordance with applicable
          data protection laws and retained for a reasonable period.
        </span>
        <h3 className='mt-1 font-semibold'>Protection Against Retaliation</h3>
        <span>
          Soltec is committed to ensuring that students who raise complaints or
          grievances are protected against retaliation or adverse consequences.
          Any form of retaliation against a student for making a complaint or
          grievance is strictly prohibited and will be subject to disciplinary
          action.

          "Force Majeure" refers to events or circumstances that are beyond the
          reasonable control of Soltec, which may include, but are not limited

        <span>
          The Academy shall not be liable for any losses, damages, or costs
          incurred by students or third parties as a result of a Force Majeure
          event, including but not limited to tuition refunds, lost income, or
          additional expenses.
        </span>
        <h3 className='mt-1 font-semibold'>Termination or Withdrawal</h3>
        <span>
          If a Force Majeure event significantly impacts the ability of Soltec
          to deliver an academic program, course, or service for an extended
          period, and alternative arrangements are not feasible, the affected
          students may be given the option to withdraw with a pro-rata refund of
          tuition paid.
        </span>
        <span>
          Soltec reserves the right to terminate enrollment if the Force Majeure
          event continues for an extended period, with no refund obligation

        </span>
        <h3 className='mt-1 font-semibold'>Mitigation</h3>
        <span>
          Soltec shall make reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of a
          Force Majeure event and to minimize any disruptions to the extent
          possible, considering the circumstances.

        <h3 className='mt-1 font-semibold'>Alternative Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <span>
          Soltec recognizes the value of alternative dispute resolution methods,
          such as negotiation, mediation and conciliation for resolving
          conflicts amicably. Prior to pursuing legal action, students and the
          Academy shall make reasonable efforts to resolve disputes through
          alternative means, as may be agreed upon by both parties.

          If any provision in this section is found to be invalid or
          unenforceable, it shall not affect the validity and enforceability of
          the remaining provisions.

        <h3 className='font-semibold'>Amendments and Modifications </h3>
        <span>
          Soltec reserves the right to amend, modify, or update these Terms and
          Conditions as necessary to reflect changes in the law, academic
          policies, institutional operations, or any other relevant factors.
          These changes may be made without prior notice to students.
        </span>
        <h3 className='mt-1 font-semibold'>Implementation of Amendments</h3>
        <span>
          Amendments to these Terms and Conditions will become effective as of
          the date specified in the notice or as otherwise provided by the
          Academy. Students enrolling after the effective date of an amendment
          shall be subject to the amended Terms and Conditions.
        </span>
        <h3 className='mt-1 font-semibold'>Grandfathering Provision</h3>
        <span>
          In the event of an amendment to these Terms and Conditions, the
          Academy recognizes the need to protect the rights and commitments of
          currently enrolled students. As such, the Academy will typically apply
          amendments to new and incoming students, while maintaining the
          existing terms and conditions for currently enrolled students.
          However, certain amendments that are required by law or for reasons of
          academic or operational necessity may apply to all students,
          regardless of their enrollment date.
        </span>
        <h3 className='mt-1 font-semibold'>Student Responsibility</h3>
        <span>
          It is the responsibility of each student to remain informed about and
          compliant with the most current version of these Terms and Conditions.
          Failure to review and abide by the Terms and Conditions, including any
          amendments, does not absolve students from their obligations under the
          Terms and Conditions.
